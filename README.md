```
### With module zip file

- Add in file `sylius/composer.json`, in autoload psr-4 the line:

```
"Lyranetwork\\Payzen\\": "LyranetworkPayzen/src/"

 ```

- Execute this command in Sylius root directory to dump the autoload cache.

```
composer dump-autoload
```

**Careful**

- Add the overrode templates. If you have already overrode one of the following files, you need to merge it with ours. You will find them in LyranetworkPayzen/Resources/views/bundles/ directory.

```
SyliusAdminBundle\PaymentMethod\_form.html.twig
SyliusAdminBundle\OrderShow\_payment.html.twig
SyliusShopBundle\Checkout\SelectPayment\_choice.html.twig
SyliusUiBundle\Form\theme.html.twig
```
- If not, just copy them with the following command, if you used the zip method to install:

```
cp -R LyranetworkPayzen/Resources/views/bundles/* templates/bundles/
```
- Or this one if you used composer :

```
cp -R vendor/lyranetwork/sylius-lyranetwork-plugin/LyranetworkPayzen/Resources/views/bundles/* templates/bundles/
```


- Open command line in Sylius root directory, and run the following commands to extract the translations for the plugin:

```
php bin/console translation:extract en LyranetworkPayzenPlugin --dump-messages
php bin/console translation:extract fr LyranetworkPayzenPlugin --dump-messages
php bin/console translation:extract es LyranetworkPayzenPlugin --dump-messages
php bin/console translation:extract de LyranetworkPayzenPlugin --dump-messages
php bin/console translation:extract pt LyranetworkPayzenPlugin --dump-messages
php bin/console translation:extract br LyranetworkPayzenPlugin --dump-messages
```

```
php bin/console cache:clear
```

The plugin should be now available in the list of payment methods that you can create.
